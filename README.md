# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
  I am using the Kickstarter Data set to evaluate if there are trends that can be used to predict future fundrasing success. 

### Purpose
  I will be looking at the parent category "theaters" in the Kickstarter Data Set to see how launch date and funding goal affects the outcome of the campaign.
  
 ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
   The rate at which projects are canceled does not seem to be impacted by the timing of the launch date.  However there is an above average success rate for campaigns launched in the Second Quarter of the year.  According to the data roughly 43% of all successful campaigns were started in the months of April, May, June, and July).
 
 ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    There is a better then 50% chance of your campaign being successful if as long as the total Goal amount is under $15,000, with your probablity of meeting your goal       right at 50% for Goals from $15,000 to $19,999.
