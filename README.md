# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
  I am using the Kickstarter Data set to evaluate if there are trends that can be used to predict future fundrasing success. 
### Purpose
 I will be looking at the parent category "theaters" in the Kickstarter Data Set to see how launch date and funding goal affects the outcome of the campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

   The rate at which projects are canceled does not seem to be impacted by the timing of the launch date.  However there is an above average success rate for campaigns launched in the Second Quarter of the year.  According to the data roughly 43% of all successful campaigns were started in the months of April, May, June, and July).
 ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  There is a better then 50% chance of havinga  successful Campaign if you Goal amount is under $15,000, with the highest rate of success in the less than $1,000 Goal     category.  Once you get into the $15,000 to $19,999 range your odds of success hover at 50/50, after that Goal level the chances for success drop rapidily with your     lowest level of success at the $25,000 to $29,999 range.  
 ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  The outcomes from the analysis did show us that there is a trend associated with success and failure based on time of launch and goal amount that may warrant more       study.  It would be interersting to see what the breakdown by goal level within each month is, this would help us rule out that, the elevated success levels in the 2nd   quarter are attributed to a higher proportion of smaller goal level campaigns.
 ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered 
  There were a disproportionate number of data points at lower dolor goal levels which made the % of success and failure for the highest goal levels unreliable.         
 ## Results
 If Louise does want to go forward with another campaign I would recommend trying to stay under the $15,000 goal limit to give her slightly favorable odds on having a successful campaign.  I would recomend starting the campaign in the 2nd quarter no matter the Goal amount.
